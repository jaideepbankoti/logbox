<h3>
Jageshwar Dham is one of the many famous temples, residing in the state Uttarakhand (The Land of the God ). It is on the hill side of Jageshwar, about 130 kilometers from my residence (Haldwani).

This shot was taken from a Nikon D5300 at | f/5.6 | 1/125s | ISO-400

The grounds were wet after some rainfall and it was evening, so it was a perfect moment for me to capture the golden tinge of the setting sun on the shrine. There were many shrines of different heights, but I chose these two because they lay in perfect alignment with the perspective. The shrines were well carved out with discreet lines and designs.

After the shot was taken, it was mandatory to post-process it, since it’s a crucial step in photography, if required. The most important part while post processing is not to alter the setting too much, that the shot start to appear unnatural. So, I tweaked the clarity and contrast a bit to make the colors stand out, plus emphasizing the golden tinge on the shrines.

Finally, after finishing up, the final image looked like the one posted here. With this composition, I plan to captivate the viewer’s eye on the leading lines of the shrines and the warm and bright golden hue that dominate and stand out in the picture.

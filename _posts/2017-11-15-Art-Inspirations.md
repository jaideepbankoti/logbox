Nowadays, art is a medium of expression for many artists, designers and enthusiasts. There is a myriad of techniques to develop art forms that are elegant and quite eye pleasing. Here, I have selected five different art and designs that are beautiful, unique and motivational.

<h2>1. Moire Design</h2>
<h3>
This type of design is very cool, elegant, simple and attractive. Moire patterns are a set of fringes that forms a continuous pattern. Some artists create it by superimposing them with an object or a living being.

<h2>2. Impressionist Art</h2>
<h3>
This is a kind of art form in which the artist visualizes the scene( which is mostly outdoors) and paints them with a lot of color. Thus, the picture comes out as bright and vibrant. This type of art form is very vivid and eye pleasing. It can certainly enhance the walls of a room and provide motivation to the artists and designers.

<h2>3. Perspective Art</h2>
<h3>
Perspective is a drawing technique widely used by artists, architects and many others to draw realistic three dimensional drawings. Moreover, it is also used to create some mind boggling optical illusions. The same set of images perfectly aligned in a diminishing perspective can create a sense of depth.

<h2>4. Double Exposure</h2>
<h3>
This art form is quite popular and finds its use in photos by superimposing a second scenary on the main subject. There are many forms of double exposure out there. It finds its application in photography, sketches and designs.

<h2>5. Geometric Art</h2>
<h3>
Every art student knows it as a rule of thumb that every subject to be drawn can be broken down for reference into simple geometry. If you ever visit an art class and you see people drawing the live model in front of them; they usually start with simple shapes like circle, triangle or any other polygon. Geometric art involves detailing the subject with geometric shapes and patterns. Such patterns may be simple or complex. Consequently, it makes the sketch stand out in a way it looks spawned out as a figure of mathematics.

<h3>I made this website as an experiment to both learn about building static websites through jekyll and store my opinions, my work, my ideas in a visual repository. I am currently a master's student of the computer science discipline from IIT Gandhinagar, India. My personal philosophy is to learn new skills and be engaged in activities to enjoy your life. I have endorsed my social media links at the bottom of the page, feel free to visit them and connect with me.</h3>
